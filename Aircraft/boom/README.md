## These xml files are to be used as a template as we populate the craft with data from other teams.

Knowing the diameter of our [turbine](http://www.kingtechturbines.com/products/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=20&products_id=118), I was able to make some educated guesses on the original Charlie team model. The only things that are being close to accurate are the dimensions of the craft as well as the engine configuration file. The rest of the xml code is comprised of chunks of code from similar aircraft. The main references being the F16, T38, and F104.
